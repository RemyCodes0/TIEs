# üé® TIEs - The Incredible Excogitatores

Welcome to **TIEs (The Incredible Excogitatores)**, an open-source web platform for incredible artists to share their artwork with the world. TIEs allows users to upload artwork, engage with others through likes and comments, participate in art-related events (and possibly competitions), and maintain a personal profile. Built using **Django**, this project is designed to foster a community of creative minds and showcase their talents.

I am 18 years old and **new to programming** with only 3 months of experience, but I‚Äôm eager to learn and improve. This project is my way of putting into practice what I‚Äôve learned so far, and I‚Äôm calling on other developers and designers to help take TIEs to the next level! 

While the backend is functional, the **frontend design** still needs improvement, and there are **known issues with the authentication system**. This is a call for passionate developers and designers to contribute to improving the platform. Whether you're a frontend or backend developer, your contributions are welcome!

## üöÄ Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage personal profiles (known issues currently being worked on).
- **Artwork Upload & Gallery**: Artists can upload and showcase their artwork, while users can browse through the gallery.
- **Likes & Comments**: Users can like and comment on each piece of artwork.
- **Ranking System**: Based on user interactions (likes and comments), artists are ranked to feature top works.
- **Event Management**: Artists and administrators can create and manage events. Future versions may include **art competitions**, where artists can compete and potentially earn money from their creations.
- **Profile System**: Users have profiles that display their artworks, rankings, and personal information (currently under optimization).

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots

(Add screenshots of the homepage, artwork gallery, event management, and user profiles here to showcase the key features of TIEs. You can place your images in a folder called `assets/images/` and reference them in the README as shown below.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Django**: Backend framework for handling user interactions, database management, and event handling.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for the structure and layout of the site (needs improvement).
- **Bootstrap**: Powers interactions like likes, comments, and ranking updates.
- **SQLite**: Default database during development (can be swapped for a production-ready DB).
-**Tailwind CSS (Planned)**: Future integration for better styling and responsive design.

## üìù Current State & Known Issues
- **Frontend Design**: The current frontend is quite basic. Contributors with expertise in frontend development (especially HTML/CSS and Tailwind CSS) are encouraged to help make TIEs more visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **Authentication Problems**: There are known issues with the login and sign-up system, which may impact user authentication flows. Help is needed to debug and improve this.
- **Profile System**: The profile section works but needs optimization and customization to enhance user experience.
- **HTML Layout Problems**: There are some layout issues with the HTML templates, which I‚Äôm actively working on. However, help in fixing these would be highly appreciated.
- **Event Management UI**: The event management system functions, but the UI could use improvements for better usability.
- **Competitions & Monetization**: Future iterations of TIEs aim to include art competitions that allow artists to earn money based on their performance in community events.

## üåü How You Can Contribute
 **Frontend Contributions**:
Enhance the User Interface: Redesign the UI using HTML/CSS or Tailwind CSS to improve the overall look and feel of the platform.
